            all my primary and high school years. I then spent a year in Israel at <span id="harova"><a href="https://harova.org/overseas.asp">Midreshet Harova</a></span> seminary in the old city of Jeruslaem
            on a Bnei Akiva program in 2018. After returning to South Africa, I began studying Electrical engineering at Witswatersrand university.
            However, after 6 months I decided I wanted to live in Israel. Mid-corona I left home and am currently studying Bsc Computer Science at Reichmann university.
            This was the best decision I have ever made and have not looked back since.
