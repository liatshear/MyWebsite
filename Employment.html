        <p id='employment'>Since I was 15 I was in charge of the kids service at my synagogue in Johannesberg.
            I have also done babysitting for the past 7 years and have experience tutoring high school kids in both 
            English and Mathematics. I hope next year to find a part time student job and begin my experience in the field.
