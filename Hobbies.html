        <div id="boxcheck"><p id='hobbies'>I have always been involved in my activities and hobbies since I was younger. These include:
            Playing chess, junior black belt in karate, ballet, hiphop dancing, netball, tennis, piano, public speaking
            and acrobatics. My hobbies as a young adult now include: swimming at the beach, going on hikes, listening to music, painting, cooking and 
            trying new foods. Checkout my instagram food page i run <span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/snackinalone/">here</a></span> called "Snackinalone".
             I love spending time with friends and going out for dinner or for a day trip to the shuk in Israel.</p>
