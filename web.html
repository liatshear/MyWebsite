        <p id='text'><b>Welcome to my website</b></p>

        <h2 class="h">Heres, a bit about me...</h2>
        </div id="box2"><p>My name is Liat Shear and I am 21 years old. 
            I was born in South Africa, Johannesburg, click <span id="jhb"><a href="https://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_5069.jpg">this link</a></span> to see the city I was born in!</p></div>
            <div id="box1"><h3 id='text' class="h">My education</h3> </div>
        <p id ='education'>I attended <span id="yc"><a href="https://www.yu.edu/yeshiva-college">Yeshiva College</a></span> school for 
            all my primary and high school years. I then spent a year in Israel at <span id="harova"><a href="https://harova.org/overseas.asp">Midreshet Harova</a></span> seminary in the old city of Jeruslaem
            on a Bnei Akiva program in 2018. After returning to South Africa, I began studying Electrical engineering at Witswatersrand university.
            However, after 6 months I decided I wanted to live in Israel. Mid-corona I left home and am currently studying Bsc Computer Science at Reichmann university.
            This was the best decision I have ever made and have not looked back since. 
        </p>
        <div id="box1"><h3 id='text' class="h">Employment</h3></div>
        <p id='employment'>Since I was 15 I was in charge of the kids service at my synagogue in Johannesberg.
            I have also done babysitting for the past 7 years and have experience tutoring high school kids in both 
            English and Mathematics. I hope next year to find a part time student job and begin my experience in the field.
        </p>
        <div id="box1"><h3 id='text' class="h">Hobbies</h3></div>
        <p id='hobbies'>I have always been involved in my activities and hobbies since I was younger. These include:
        Playing chess, junior black belt in karate, ballet, hiphop dancing, netball, tennis, piano, public speaking
        and acrobatics. My hobbies as a young adult now include: swimming at the beach, going on hikes, listening to music, painting, cooking and 
        trying new foods. I love spending time with friends and going out for dinner or for a day trip to the shuk in Israel.</p>
